The correct fill would be [THEY]. Here's why: ""has"" is a singular subject, and it refers to a person who is doing something (in this case, being fascinated). The verb ""been"" agrees with the singular subject, so we need a singular pronoun to complete the sentence. ""They"" is the correct choice because it's a third-person singular pronoun that fits grammatically and makes sense contextually.
