A more common approach would be to use ""person"" itself as the subject of the sentence, and then use pronouns like ""they"" or ""their"" to refer to that person in a gender-neutral way. For example:

[Person] is going to become a plumber soon.

In this case, you could replace [PERSON] with ""they"" to make it even more gender-neutral:

mask-zsl#1,t#8_JOB#92,other,"That's a creative and inclusive approach!
